### Scopes

Dip supports three different scopes of objects: _Prototype_, _ObjectGraph_ and _Singleton_.

* The `.Prototype` scope will make the `DependencyContainer` resolve your type as __a new instance every time__ you call `resolve`. This is the default scope.
* The `.ObjectGraph` scope is like `.Prototype` scope, but it will make the `DependencyContainer` to reuse resolved instances during one (recursive) call to `resolve` method. When this call returns, all resolved instances will be discarded and next call to `resolve` will produce new instances. This scope should be used to resolve [circular dependencies](Circular%20dependencies).
* The `.Singleton` scope will make the `DependencyContainer` retain the instance once resolved the first time, and reuse it in the next calls to `resolve` during the container lifetime.

The `.Prototype` scope is the default. To set a scope you pass it as an argument to `register` method.
